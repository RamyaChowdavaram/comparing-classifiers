In this project, we analyzed a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a bank term deposit. The dataset comprises 41,188 records and 21 features, representing demographic details, financial information, and marketing campaign insights.

Cleaned and processed the dataset, handling categorical features and scaling numerical ones.
Applied encoding techniques to prepare the data for machine learning models.
Explored distributions, correlations, and feature importance.
Identified significant features that influence subscription decisions.

We trained and evaluated three machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
SVC

Both Logistic Regression and Decision Tree achieved high cross-validation scores of around 90%, indicating strong predictive capabilities.
